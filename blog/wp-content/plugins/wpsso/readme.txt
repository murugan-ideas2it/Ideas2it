== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png">

<p><strong>WPSSO uses your <em>existing</em> content to create meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, <em>but if you want to</em>, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including hashtags, video seo, e-commerce products, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO offers special optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; providing an image for the Pin It button, excluding non-relevant images, and preventing conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook meta tag values.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO includes advanced <em>quality control</em> features and options</strong> &mdash; checking minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, verifying the webpage for duplicate meta tags, showing notices for missing and required images, along with theme header template validation.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin!</strong> &mdash; WPSSO specializes in providing all the meta tags + Schema markup social sites and search engines need, and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO offers a <em>fast</em> and <em>reliable</em> social framework for developers</strong> &mdash; offering dozens of 3rd party integration modules in the Pro version, several Free and Pro extensions, and hundreds of filter hooks to easily customize WPSSO's behavior and output.</p>

= Complete Social Meta Tags =

WPSSO adds Facebook / Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and all social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, hashtags, images, videos, e-commerce product details, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). WPSSO uses *existing* content to generate meta tags + Schema markup &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values.

= 3rd Party Integration (Pro version) =

**Images and Videos**

WPSSO detects and uses all images - associated or included in your content - including the WordPress image gallery and [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) shortcodes. WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized according to their intended consumer (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). The Pro version detects embedded videos from Facebook, Slideshare, Vimeo, Wistia, and Youtube (including preview image, video title, and video description). WPSSO (Pro version) also includes support for [NextGEN Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

<img class="readme-example" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/images/social/pinterest-pin-wpsso-zoomed.png">

= Proven Performance =

WPSSO is *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features. WPSSO requires PHP v5.3 or better, and is fully compatible with PHP v7.

= Professional Support =

WPSSO support and development is on-going. You can review the [FAQ](https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/faqs/) and [Notes](https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/notes/) pages for additional setup information.

<blockquote class="top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
